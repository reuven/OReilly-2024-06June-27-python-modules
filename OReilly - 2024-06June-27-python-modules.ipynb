    "One of the most important ideas in programming is DRY (don't repeat yourself). If you have code that repeats in your program, you're probably doing something wrong.\n",

    "- If you have several lines in a row that are the same (or close to it), then you can use a loop.\n",
    "- If you have the same code in several places in your program, then you can put them into a function, and invoke the function in various places.\n",
    "- If you have the same code in several different programs, then you'll want to use a *library*.\n",

    "- We don't have to work as hard; we write the code once, and then refer to it many times.\n",
    "- If/when something goes wrong, we only have to debug/fix the code in one place.\n",
    "- When we read code, there's less to read, and thus to understand/wrap our minds around.\n",

    "- They provide us with all of the normal advantages of libraries\n",
    "- Modules also provide us with *namespaces*, ensuring that the variables created in one place don't interfere with those in another place."
