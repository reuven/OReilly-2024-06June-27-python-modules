    "\n",
    "- If you have several lines in a row that are the same (or close to it), then you can use a loop.\n",
    "- If you have the same code in several places in your program, then you can put them into a function, and invoke the function in various places.\n",
    "- If you have the same code in several different programs, then you'll want to use a *library*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just about every programming language has libraries. In Python, we call our libraries \"modules.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the advantages of using a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don't have to work as hard; we write the code once, and then refer to it many times.\n",
    "- If/when something goes wrong, we only have to debug/fix the code in one place.\n",
    "- When we read code, there's less to read, and thus to understand/wrap our minds around.\n",

    "In Python, modules actually do two different things:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `import` is not a function. So don't use parentheses around its argument.\n",
    "2. `import` is a Python keyword. So you cannot redefine it, even if you want to.\n",
    "3. The argument we give to `import` is not a string. It's not a Python data structure at all. When you `import`, you're really doing two things:\n",
    "    - Creating a new module object, based on the contents of a file on disk\n",
    "    - Defining a variable ... the name that you gave\n",
    "4. If you use an existing variable name after `import`, assuming that it works, you have now overwritten the original value."
